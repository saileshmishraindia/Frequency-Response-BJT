# FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF BJT AMPLIFIERS

## FREQUENCY RESPONSE

**Frequency response** refers to how an amplifier’s gain varies with the frequency of the input signal. It reveals the **range of frequencies** over which the amplifier operates efficiently, showing regions of **maximum, constant, and attenuated gain**.

## SIGNIFICANCE OF FREQUENCY RESPONSE ANALYSIS IN IC DESIGN

**✔ Determines amplifier performance in real-world signals.**  
**✔ Helps in bandwidth estimation for analog and mixed-signal ICs.**  
**✔ Essential in designing filters, communication circuits, and sensor interfaces.**  
**✔ Indicates how parasitics and capacitances affect signal integrity.**

## LOW FREQUENCY RESPONSE ANALYSIS

At low frequencies, **coupling capacitors, bypass capacitors, and emitter resistance** dominate the behavior.

**Key Factors:**
- **Coupling capacitor (Cc)** causes roll-off at low frequencies.
- **Bypass capacitor (Ce)** affects gain restoration at mid-band.
- **Lower Cut-off Frequency (fL)** determined using:  
  \[
  f_L = \frac{1}{2\pi RC}
  \]


## MATHEMATICAL INSIGHTS

## Circuit Description

For a **Common Emitter amplifier** with **voltage divider biasing**:

- Bias network: **R1**, **R2**
- Input side: **AC source** with **coupling capacitor Cs**
- Amplifier body: **RC**, **RE** and **bypassed CE**
- Output side: **coupling capacitor Cc** and **load resistor RL**
- Transistor parameters: **β (beta or hFE)**, **re (intrinsic emitter resistance)**

### Bias Point

To keep BJT in **Active Region**:

**$V_{B} = V_{CC} \cdot \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} > 0.69 \, \text{V}$**

This ensures:

- Forward bias of **base-emitter junction**
- Proper **Q-point** setting

## Voltage Gain (AV)

Assuming **RE is bypassed** and **Rs is ignored**:

### Voltage Gain Expression:

**$A_V = \frac{V_o}{V_i} = -\frac{R_C \parallel R_L}{r_e}$**

Where:

**$r_e = \frac{V_T}{I_E} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{0.0259}{I_E} \quad \text{(at room temp)}$**

Also:

**$I_C = I_S \cdot \exp\left( \frac{V_{BE}}{V_T} \right)$**

Therefore, **re** is:

- **Inversely proportional to IE**
- **Dependent on VBE (threshold voltage ~0.7V)**

### Expanded AV Expression:

**$A_V = -\frac{(R_C \parallel R_L) \cdot I_E}{V_T} = -\frac{(R_C \cdot R_L)}{R_C + R_L} \cdot \frac{I_E}{V_T}$**

### Gain in Decibels:

**$A_V(\text{dB}) = 20 \cdot \log_{10}\left( \left| \frac{V_o}{V_i} \right| \right)$**

## Cut-off Frequencies $f_L$

We're analyzing **low-frequency response**, hence:

- Focus on **3 capacitors**: **Cs**, **Cc**, and **CE**
- Each contributes to **fL** (lower cut-off freq)

## SOURCE CAPACITOR $Cs$

**$f_{L_{Cs}} = \frac{1}{2\pi R_{in} C_s}$**

Where:

**$R_{in} = (R_1 \parallel R_2) \parallel \beta r_e = \frac{(R_{eq} \cdot \beta r_e)}{R_{eq} + \beta r_e}$**

**$f_{L_{Cs}} = \frac{R_{eq} + \beta r_e}{2\pi C_s R_{eq} \beta r_e}$**

**Design Implication:**  
Larger $C_s$ → Smaller $f_{L_{Cs}}$ → **Better low-frequency response**

## OUTPUT COUPLING CAPACITOR $Cc$

**$f_{L_{Cc}} = \frac{1}{2\pi (R_o + R_L) C_c}$**

Where:

**$R_o = R_C \parallel r_o = \frac{R_C \cdot r_o}{R_C + r_o}$**

From the Denominator , R_O + R_L = 

$$
\left( \frac{R_C \cdot r_o}{R_C + r_o} + R_L \right)= \frac{R_C \cdot r_o + R_L (R_C + r_o)}{R_C + r_o}
$$

Substitute back:

$$
f_{L_{Cc}} = \frac{1}{2\pi C_c \left( \frac{R_C \cdot r_o + R_L (R_C + r_o)}{R_C + r_o} \right)}
$$

Invert the denominator:

$$
f_{L_{Cc}} = \frac{R_C + r_o}{2\pi C_c \left( R_C \cdot r_o + R_L (R_C + r_o) \right)}
$$

### Final Simplified Expression:

$$
f_{L_{Cc}} = \frac{R_C + r_o}{2\pi C_c \left( R_C \cdot r_o + R_L (R_C + r_o) \right)}
$$

**$f_{L_{Cc}} = \frac{1}{2\pi \left( \frac{R_C \cdot r_o}{R_C + r_o} + R_L \right) C_c}$**



**Design Implication:**  
Larger $C_c$ → Smaller $f_{L_{Cc}}$ → **Improved low-frequency coupling**


## Bypass Capacitor $CE$

 **$f_{L_{CE}} = \frac{1}{2\pi C_E R_e}$**

Where:

 **$R_e = R_E \parallel \left( \frac{R_1 \parallel R_2}{\beta} + r_e \right)$**

This becomes:

 **$R_e = R_E \parallel \left( \frac{R_{eq}}{\beta} + r_e \right)$**

**Design Implication:**  
Larger $C_E$ → Lower $f_{L_{CE}}$ → **Better gain at low frequency**

## Overall Bandwidth:

 **$BW = f_H - f_L \approx f_H \quad \text{(if } f_L \ll f_H \text{)}$**

Where:

- $f_L = \max(f_{L_{Cs}}, f_{L_{Cc}}, f_{L_{CE}})$
- $f_H$ is typically in MHz range

## Summary:

- **Low-frequency response is dominated by coupling and bypass capacitors.**
- **Increasing Cs, Cc, or CE improves bandwidth by lowering fL.**
- **Voltage gain depends on IE and load resistors.**
- **Effective design tweaks optimize both gain and bandwidth.** 

## HIGH FREQUENCY RESPONSE ANALYSIS

At high frequencies, **internal BJT capacitances** and **parasitic elements** become dominant.

**Key Points:**
- **Base spreading resistance** and **Miller capacitance** impact the gain.
- **Upper Cut-off Frequency (fH)** marks the start of gain drop.
- **Transition Frequency (fT)** is when current gain (β) falls to 1.

## GAIN & BANDWIDTH (BW) ANALYSIS

- **Midband Gain (Av):** Flat region in the gain vs. frequency curve.
- **Bandwidth (BW):**  
  \[
  BW = f_H - f_L
  \]
- **Gain-Bandwidth Trade-off:** High gain often narrows bandwidth and vice versa.

## CIRCUIT OPTIMIZATION

**✔ Optimize biasing to stabilize Q-point.**  
**✔ Select capacitor values based on desired fL and fH.**  
**✔ Use emitter degeneration for improved linearity at cost of gain.**  
**✔ Apply feedback or compensation techniques to manage high-frequency roll-off.**


## DESIGN STRATEGY / METHODOLOGY / TECHNIQUES TO LEVERAGE THE TRADE-OFFS [Application Based]

### GAIN MORE PRIOR THAN BANDWIDTH

**Practical Example: Loud Speaker / Public Addressing System**  
**✔ Application needs amplification of audio (low freq.) signals.**  
**✔ High gain ensures audibility over large areas.**  
**✔ Bandwidth is less critical; hence, low-pass filtering is tolerable.**

### BANDWIDTH MORE PRIOR THAN GAIN

**Practical Example: FM Radio Receiver**  
**✔ Must handle a broad spectrum of frequencies (88–108 MHz).**  
**✔ Bandwidth is crucial for signal clarity and fidelity.**  
**✔ Moderate gain is sufficient, emphasis on flat frequency response.**
